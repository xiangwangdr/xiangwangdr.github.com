## Basic formatting

This note **demonstrates** some of what [Markdown][1] is *capable of doing*.

And that's how to do it.

{% highlight html %}

## Headings

There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character. But we are using just 4 of them.

# Headings can be small

## URLs

URLs can be made in a handful of ways:

* A named link to [Mark It Down][3].
* Another named link to [Mark It Down](http://markitdown.net/)
* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://markitdown.net/>.

{% highlight raw %}
* A named link to [MarkItDown][3].
* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://markitdown.net/)
* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://markitdown.net/>.

## Horizontal rule

A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.
It's sometimes handy for breaking things up.

## Images

Markdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.

{% highlight raw %}
![Markdowm Image][/image/url]
{% endhighlight %}

![Markdowm Image][6]

*Figure Caption*?

{% highlight raw %}
![Markdowm Image][/image/url]
<figcaption class="caption">Photo by John Doe</figcaption>
{% endhighlight %}

![Markdowm Image][6]
<figcaption class="caption">Photo by John Doe</figcaption>

*Bigger Images*?

{% highlight raw %}
![Markdowm Image][/image/url]{: class="bigger-image" }
{% endhighlight %}

![Markdowm Image][6]{: class="bigger-image" }
