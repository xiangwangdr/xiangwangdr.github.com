<p align="center">Broadly my interests involve aspects of scientific computing and numerical analysis with particular
interest in the numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. Specifically I work
with adaptive numerical methods known as moving mesh methods for PDEs. Related interests
include numerical linear algebra, domain decomposition methods including Schwarz waveform
relaxation, large scale optimization, and multirate methods for ODEs.</p>
