## Well Placement Optimization

* Four separate optimization problems related to well pattern adjustment are addressed. The problems include: (a) well location optimization for new vertical wells; (b) well trajectory optimization for new 3D angled wells; (c) well status (open/shut) optimization for existing wells; (d) well type (producer/injector) optimization for existing wells.
* A framework is established to address the generalized well pattern adjustment optimization.

## Well Control Optimization

* The well control optimization formulation and methodology are presented.
* A multiscale regularization framework is investigated to optimize the control frequency and the well controls simultaneously, and to speed up the convergence.

---

## Joint Placement and Control Optimization

* Two approaches, the simultaneous approach and the sequential approach, are investigated for the joint optimization problem. 
* The performance and adaptability of the two approaches are analyzed and discussed. Although the simultaneous procedure can theoretically obtain the global optima, the sequential procedure is worth considering in practice.

## Optimization Algorithm

* Four derivative-free algorithms, GPS, PSO, CMA-ES, and MCS, are investigated and compared for well placement, well control, and joint optimization problems.
* A MCS-CMA-ES hybrid algorithm is established and studied.
* The constraint handing strategies for derivative-free algorithms are investigated and discussed.

## Reservoir Simulation

* Several simulators, Eclipse, CMG, and MRST, are used in my study.
* A semi-analytical method, dynamic flooding unit split method, is developed to predict water flooding dynamics efficiently.
* A streamline simulation method considering full permeability tensor is established.

## Reservoir Development Evaluation

* Equilibrium displacement is proved the most efficient and the most economical development strategy for water flooding reservoir.
* An indicator, saturation standard deviation (SSD), is presented to evaluate the displacement equalization degree, and is used as the objective function for well placement and production optimization problems.
